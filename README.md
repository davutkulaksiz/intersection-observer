# React Application Performance Optimization with Intersection Observer API

## Overview
This project aims to optimize the performance of a React application by utilizing the Intersection Observer API. By employing this API, we can efficiently handle the visibility of elements on the page and trigger actions or updates only when necessary.

## Features
- Improve performance by reducing unnecessary rendering or processing of hidden or off-screen elements.
- Lazy loading of images when they come into view.
